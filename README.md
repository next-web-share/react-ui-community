# React UI Community

React UI Community is a GitHub organization dedicated to the collaborative and community-driven long-term maintenance of React packages & libraries.

We want to, through our community, define the code quality and professionalism among the members - to set an example that everyone in the broader development community should strive towards and imitate.

The primary expression of this is through code; the organization provides a place to host open source React packages that benefit from collective maintenance. By publishing guidelines and providing every repository with a set of default documents (e.g. code styling and licensing) we aim to make it easier for everyone involved to feel enabled to achieve their best.

Finally; we aspire to create a diverse and inclusive environment, through open-mindedness and acceptance. This environment is reflected upon and enforced via a standard Code of Conduct shared across the whole organization.
